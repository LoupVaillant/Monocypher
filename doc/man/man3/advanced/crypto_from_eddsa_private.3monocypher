.Sh NAME
.Nm crypto_from_eddsa_private ,
.Nm crypto_from_eddsa_public
.Nd conversion of key pairs for EdDSA with BLAKE2b to X25519 key pairs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In monocypher.h
.Ft void
.Fo crypto_from_eddsa_private
.Fa "uint8_t x25519[32]"
.Fa "const uint8_t eddsa[32]"

.Ft void
.Fo crypto_from_eddsa_public
.Fa "uint8_t x25519[32]"
.Fa "const uint8_t eddsa[32]"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions convert keys for use with
.Xr crypto_sign 3monocypher
(EdDSA with the BLAKE2b hash function)
to keys for use with
.Xr crypto_x25519 3monocypher
and
.Xr crypto_x25519 3monocypher .
This may be useful in some resource-constrained contexts or when no
other key is available \(en for example when retrieving SSH public keys
from GitHub and reusing the SSH public keys as X25519 public keys.
.Pp
The
.Fn crypto_from_eddsa_private
function converts an EdDSA (with BLAKE2b) private key to an X25519
private key.
The
.Fn crypto_from_eddsa_public
function converts an EdDSA public key to an X25519 public key.
.Pp
X25519 key pairs cannot be converted back to EdDSA key pairs.
The conversion of private keys is specific to EdDSA with BLAKE2b because
of the way EdDSA works.
In particular, this means that the output of
.Fn crypto_from_eddsa_private
differs from
.Xr crypto_from_ed25519_private 3monocypher
in the optional code.
However, the output of
.Fn crypto_from_eddsa_public
is identical to
.Xr crypto_from_ed25519_public 3monocypher .
.Pp
The arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fa eddsa
The signing public key or private key to convert to a X25519 public key
or private key, respectively.
.It Fa x25519
The converted private key or public key.
.El
.Pp
The arguments may overlap or point at the same buffer.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return nothing.
They cannot fail.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr crypto_x25519 3monocypher ,
.Xr crypto_sign_public_key 3monocypher ,
.Xr intro 3monocypher
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn crypto_from_eddsa_private
and
.Fn crypto_from_eddsa_public
functions first appeared in Monocypher 3.1.0.
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
It is generally considered poor form to reuse the same key for different
purposes.
While this conversion is technically safe,
avoid these functions nonetheless unless you are particularly
resource-constrained or have some other kind of hard requirement.
It is otherwise an unnecessary risk factor.
