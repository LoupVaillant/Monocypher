.Sh DESCRIPTION
BLAKE2b is a fast cryptographically secure hash based on the ideas of
ChaCha20.
It is faster than MD5, yet just as secure as SHA-3.
.Pp
Note that BLAKE2b itself is not suitable for hashing passwords and
deriving keys from them;
use the
.Xr crypto_argon2i 3monocypher
family of functions for that purpose instead.
.Pp
BLAKE2b is immune to length extension attacks, and as such, does not
require specific precautions such as using the HMAC algorithm.
.Pp
The arguments to
.Fn crypto_blake2b
are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fa config
The configuration parameter structure, see below.
.It Fa hash
The output hash.
.It Fa message
The message to hash.
May overlap with
.Fa hash .
May be
.Dv NULL
if
.Fa message_size
is 0.
.It Fa message_size
Length of
.Fa message ,
in bytes.
.El
.Pp
The BLAKE2b hash function has configurable parameters to personalize
instances.
These parameters are given in a
.Vt crypto_blake2b_config
structure,
which is defined as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset Ds
typedef struct {
	const uint8_t *key;
	size_t key_size;
	size_t hash_size;
} crypto_blake2b_config;
.Ed
.Pp
Its members are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fa hash_size
Length of
.Fa hash ,
in bytes.
Must be between 1 and 64.
Anything below 32 is discouraged when using BLAKE2b as a general-purpose
hash function;
anything below 16 is discouraged when using BLAKE2b as a message
authentication code.
.It Fa key
Some secret key.
One cannot predict the final hash without it.
May be
.Dv NULL
if
.Fa key_size
is 0, in which case no key is used.
Keys can be used to create a message authentication code (MAC).
Use
.Xr crypto_verify16 3monocypher ,
.Xr crypto_verify32 3monocypher ,
or
.Xr crypto_verify64 3monocypher
to compare MACs created this way.
Choose the size of the hash accordingly.
Users may want to wipe the key with
.Xr crypto_wipe 3monocypher
once they are done with it.
.It Fa key_size
Length of
.Fa key ,
in bytes.
Must be between 0 and 64.
32 is a good default.
.El
.Pp
The
.Dv crypto_blake2b_defaults
constant provides default
.Fa config
parameters:
no key and a hash size of 64 bytes.
.Pp
An incremental interface is provided.
It is useful for handling streams of data or
large files without using too much memory.
This interface uses three steps:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Initialisation with
.Fn crypto_blake2b_init ,
which sets up a context with the hashing parameters;
.It
Update with
.Fn crypto_blake2b_update ,
which hashes the message chunk by chunk and keeps the intermediary
result in the context;
.It
and Finalisation with
.Fn crypto_blake2b_final ,
which produces the final hash.
The
.Ft crypto_blake2b_ctx
is automatically wiped upon finalisation.
.El
.Pp
.Fn crypto_blake2b
is a convenience function that calls
.Fn crypto_blake2b_init ,
.Fn crypto_blake2b_update ,
and
.Fn crypto_blake2b_final
under the hood.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return nothing.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following examples assume the existence of
.Fn arc4random_buf ,
which fills the given buffer with cryptographically secure random bytes.
If
.Fn arc4random_buf
does not exist on your system, see
.Xr intro 3monocypher
for advice about how to generate cryptographically secure random bytes.
.Pp
Hashing a message all at once:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
uint8_t hash   [64]; /* Output hash (64 bytes)          */
uint8_t message[12] = "Lorem ipsum"; /* Message to hash */
crypto_blake2b(hash, crypto_blake2b_defaults, message, 12);
.Ed
.Pp
Computing a message authentication code all at once:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
uint8_t hash   [16];
uint8_t key    [32];
uint8_t message[11] = "Lorem ipsu"; /* Message to authenticate */
arc4random_buf(key, sizeof(key));
crypto_blake2b_config config = {
	.key       = key,
	.key_size  = sizeof(key),
	.hash_size = sizeof(hash),
};
crypto_blake2b(hash, config, message, sizeof(message));
/* Wipe secrets if they are no longer needed */
crypto_wipe(message, sizeof(message));
crypto_wipe(key,     sizeof(key));
.Ed
.Pp
Hashing a message incrementally (without a key):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
uint8_t hash   [ 64]; /* Output hash (64 bytes) */
uint8_t message[500] = {1}; /* Message to hash  */
crypto_blake2b_ctx ctx;
crypto_blake2b_init(&ctx, crypto_blake2b_defaults);
for (size_t i = 0; i < 500; i += 100) {
    crypto_blake2b_update(&ctx, message + i, 100);
}
crypto_blake2b_final(&ctx, hash);
.Ed
.Pp
Computing a message authentication code incrementally:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
uint8_t hash   [ 16];
uint8_t key    [ 32];
uint8_t message[500] = {1}; /* Message to authenticate */
arc4random_buf(key, sizeof(key));
crypto_blake2b_ctx ctx;
crypto_blake2b_config config = {
	.key       = key,
	.key_size  = sizeof(key),
	.hash_size = sizeof(hash),
};
crypto_blake2b_init(&ctx, config);
/* Wipe the key */
crypto_wipe(key, sizeof(key));
for (size_t i = 0; i < 500; i += 100) {
    crypto_blake2b_update(&ctx, message + i, 100);
    /* Wipe secrets if they are no longer needed */
    crypto_wipe(message + i, 100);
}
crypto_blake2b_final(&ctx, hash);

.Sh STANDARDS
These functions implement BLAKE2b, described in RFC 7693.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn crypto_blake2b ,
.Fn crypto_blake2b_init ,
.Fn crypto_blake2b_update ,
and
.Fn crypto_blake2b_final
functions first appeared in Monocypher 0.1.
In Monocypher 4.0.0,
.Fn crypto_blake2b_general
and
.Fn crypto_blake2b_general_init
were removed,
and the
.Fa config
argument was added to
.Fn crypto_blake2b ,
.Fn crypto_blake2b_init
to compensate.
.Sh CAVEATS
Monocypher does not perform any input validation.
Any deviation from the specified input and output length ranges results
in
.Sy undefined behaviour .
Make sure your inputs are correct.
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
BLAKE2b is a general-purpose cryptographic hash function;
this means that it is not suited for hashing passwords and deriving
cryptographic keys from passwords.
While cryptographic keys usually have hundreds of bits of entropy,
passwords are often much less complex.
When storing passwords as hashes or when deriving keys from them,
the goal is normally to prevent attackers from quickly iterating all
possible passwords.
Because passwords tend to be simple,
it is important to artificially slow down attackers by using
computationally difficult hashing algorithms.
Monocypher therefore provides
.Xr crypto_argon2i 3monocypher
for password hashing and deriving keys from passwords.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
The core loop is unrolled by default.
This speeds up BLAKE2b by about 20% on modern processors.
On the other hand,
this inflates the binary size by several kilobytes,
and is slower on some embedded platforms.
To roll the loop and generate a smaller binary,
compile Monocypher with the -DBLAKE2_NO_UNROLLING option.
