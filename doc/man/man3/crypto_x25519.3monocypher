.Sh NAME
.Nm crypto_x25519 ,
.Nm crypto_x25519_public_key
.Nd X25519 key exchange (Public Key Cryptography)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In monocypher.h
.Ft void
.Fo crypto_x25519
.Fa "uint8_t raw_shared_secret[32]"
.Fa "const uint8_t your_secret_key[32]"
.Fa "const uint8_t their_public_key[32]"
.Fc
.Ft void
.Fo crypto_x25519_public_key
.Fa "uint8_t your_public_key[32]"
.Fa "const uint8_t your_secret_key[32]"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn crypto_x25519
computes a shared secret with
.Fa your_secret_key
and
.Fa their_public_key .
It is a low-level primitive;
X25519 is a building block for protocols.
To perform a key exchange,
use a higher level protocol,
such as the X3DH key agreement protocol.
.Pp
.Fn crypto_x25519_public_key
deterministically computes the public key from a random secret key.
.Pp
The arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fa raw_shared_secret
The shared secret, known only to those who know a relevant secret key
(yours or theirs).
It is not cryptographically random.
Do not use it directly as a key.
Hash it concatenated with
.Fa your_public_key
and
.Fa their_public_key
using
.Xr crypto_blake2b 3monocypher
for key derivation.
.It Fa your_secret_key
A 32-byte secret random number.
See
.Xr intro 3monocypher
for advice about generating random bytes (use the operating system's
random number generator).
.It Fa their_public_key
The public key of the other party.
.Pp
.Fa raw_shared_secret
and
.Fa your_secret_key
may overlap if your secret is no longer required.
.El
.Pp
Some protocols,
such as some password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocols
and oblivious pseudo-random functions (OPRF),
may require
.Dq contributory
behaviour, which ensures that no untrusted party forces the shared
secret to a known constant.
If a protocol requires contributory behaviour,
compare the output of
.Fn crypto_x25519
to an all-zero buffer using
.Xr crypto_verify32 3monocypher ,
then abort the protocol if the output and the all-zero buffer are equal.
.Pp
Do not use the same secret key for both key exchanges and signatures.
The public keys are different and revealing both may leak information.
If there really is no room to store or derive two different secret keys,
consider generating a key pair for signatures and then converting it
with
.Xr crypto_from_eddsa_private 3monocypher
and
.Xr crypto_from_eddsa_public 3monocypher .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn crypto_x25519
and
.Fn crypto_x25519_public_key
return nothing.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example assumes the existence of
.Fn arc4random_buf ,
which fills the given buffer with cryptographically secure random bytes.
If
.Fn arc4random_buf
does not exist on your system, see
.Xr intro 3monocypher
for advice about how to generate cryptographically secure random bytes.
.Pp
Generate a pair of shared keys with your secret key and their public
key
(this can help nonce management for full duplex communications).

.Sh STANDARDS
This function implements X25519, described in RFC 7748.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn crypto_x25519
and
.Fn crypto_x25519_public_key
functions first appeared in Monocypher 0.1.
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
If either of the long-term secret keys leaks, it may compromise
.Em all past messages .
This can be avoided by using protocols that provide forward secrecy,
such as the X3DH key agreement protocol.
.Pp
Many (private, public) key pairs produce the same shared secret.
Therefore, not including the public keys in the key derivation can
lead to subtle vulnerabilities.
This can be avoided by hashing the shared secret concatenated with
both public keys.
For example,
.D1 BLAKE2b(shared_secret || your_pk || their_pk)
using
.Xr crypto_blake2b 3monocypher .
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
The most significant bit of the public key is systematically ignored.
It is not needed because every public key should be smaller than
2^255-19, which fits in 255 bits.
If another implementation of X25519 gives you a key that is not fully
reduced and has its high bit set, the computation will fail.
On the other hand, it also means you may use this bit for other purposes
(such as parity flipping for Ed25519 compatibility).
